# SnapTag Extension Icons

The Chrome extension requires PNG icons in the following sizes:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Setup

You can create simple placeholder icons by:

1. **Using any image editor** (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. **Create a simple design** with the SnapTag logo or "ST" text
3. **Use the brand color**: `#3B82F6` (blue)
4. **Export as PNG** in the required sizes

## Temporary Solution

For immediate testing, you can:

1. Create a simple 128x128 blue square with "ST" text
2. Resize it to create the other sizes
3. Place them in the `extension/icons/` folder

## Professional Icons

For production, create proper icons with:
- Clear, recognizable symbol
- Good contrast for both light/dark toolbars
- Consistent with SnapTag branding
- Optimized PNG files

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
